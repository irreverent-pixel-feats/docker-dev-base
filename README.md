# docker-dev-base [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/irreverent-pixel-feats/docker-dev-base.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/irreverent-pixel-feats/docker-dev-base)

Its a little slow (especially for emacs) developing from inside a docker container, but its handy
for being productive while you are getting your native system setup or for experimenting with
new shells, editors, plugin upgrades, build tool upgrades etc...

I.e its a nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live there.

Built images are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/irreverentpixelfeats/dev-base/)

Includes:

- `emacs-25 + spacemacs`
- `neovim`

Some of our random tools.
